# Pomodoro clock
Hello dear guests. This pomodoro clock is about time managment to more productively spend your time. More about this approach of time managment can be found on wikipedia. 
Final version is available online - https://d3slife.github.io/pomodoro_clock/
I have to mention that this project is a part of a larger curriculum which can be found on theodinproject.com.
